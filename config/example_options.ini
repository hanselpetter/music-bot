; The bot must be restarted for edits to take effect, but a reload command will be created in the future.

; Change this if you don't want commands to trigger another bot

;	CommandPrefix = *
;   This means you use *play, etc.  This explanation exists because it seems no one knows what "prefix" means.

; Restrict the bot to only listen to certain channels.  Uncomment and add channel IDs to enable.
; An id looks like this number: 41771983423143930
; To get a channel id, escape a channel mention in chat and copy the number: \#your-music-channel
; or right click the channel in discord and click "Copy Link".  The second number is the channel id.
; Example: BindToChannels = 41000000000000005 41000000000000007
